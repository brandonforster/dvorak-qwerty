Delphi IDE setup to compile DVAssist.dpr
========================================

DVAssist can be built (and is currently maintained) with a copy of Turbo Delphi
for Windows, available for free from codegear.com. Unfortunately, the free Turbo
version does not allow 3rd party controls to be registered in the IDE, so the
few custom components used by DVAssist are no longer usable at design-time, but
are now created at run-time. Code should compile 'out of the box' with no
further setup.
