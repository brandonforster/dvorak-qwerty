<h1>Dverty</h1>

<p>Dverty is a regular US Dvorak keyboard layout but toggles to Qwerty while the Ctrl button is held down.</p>

<p>Keyboard shortcuts are always designed with Qwerty layouts in mind.  Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste can all be done in Qwerty with one hand, but not in Dvorak.  Dverty solves this problem.</p>

<p>Dverty has only been tested on a Windows XP system.  Use at your own risk.</p>

<p>Also available is a modified version of <a href="http://clabs.org/dvorak.htm">DVAssist</a>, a neat program that lets you easily switch between Qwerty and Dvorak.  This version switches between Qwerty and Dverty.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>There are known issues where some keys in CapsLock mode are broken.  I haven't had time to fix this.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dvorak-qwerty/">dvorak-qwerty</a> project for a solution that works on Linux and Windows.  I haven't tried this yet, though it looks promising.</p>
